# Beyond Reach - A NWHacks 2020 project
For NWHacks 2020 3 of us made a 2D space platformer game called Beyond Reach. The core idea / mechanic was that the player would have to navigate environments in zero gravity, and only grab onto certain surfaces.

This was our first time ever making a game, doing music, or pixel art. We implemented the game in the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).

Overall I'm very happy with what we accomplished in 24 hours, and we even placed in the top 30 teams!
